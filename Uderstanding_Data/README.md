### Analysis of Training and Test Data

#### 1. **Training Data Overview**
- The training dataset consists of **76,518 rows** and **38 columns**.
- The columns include various features such as:
  - **Demographics**: Marital status, Nationality, Age at enrollment.
  - **Academic Details**: Previous qualification and grade, Admission grade, Curricular unit performance (1st and 2nd semester).
  - **External Factors**: Unemployment rate, Inflation rate, GDP.
  - **Target Variable**: ‘Target’, which includes three classes: `Graduate`, `Dropout`, and `Enrolled`.
- All columns are either `int64` or `float64` types, indicating no categorical or string columns.

#### 2. **Target Variable Distribution**
- The `Target` column is **imbalanced**, with the following distribution:
  - `Graduate`: **36,282 instances (47.4%)**
  - `Dropout`: **25,296 instances (33%)**
  - `Enrolled`: **14,940 instances (19.6%)**

**Observation**:
The imbalance in the `Target` variable suggests that modeling may require techniques to handle this imbalance, such as using balanced class weights or resampling methods.

#### 3. **Missing Values in Training Data**
- The training dataset contains **no missing values** across all 38 columns. This ensures that the dataset is ready for preprocessing and modeling without requiring imputation.

#### 4. **Test Data Overview**
- The test dataset consists of **51,012 rows** and **37 columns**, similar in structure to the training data but without the `Target` column.
- Key features include:
  - Academic and demographic data (e.g., ‘Previous qualification’, ‘Admission grade’).
  - Performance metrics for curricular units in the 1st and 2nd semesters.
  - External factors (‘Unemployment rate’, ‘Inflation rate’, ‘GDP’).

#### 5. **Missing Values in Test Data**
- Similar to the training data, the test dataset contains **no missing values** in any column, ensuring consistency and compatibility with the training dataset.

#### 6. **Insights from the Data**
- **No Missing Data**: Both the training and test datasets are complete, with no null values in any columns.
- **Target Imbalance**: The `Target` variable in the training dataset is imbalanced, which could influence model performance if not addressed.
- **Consistency**: The test dataset mirrors the structure and formatting of the training dataset (excluding the `Target` column), ensuring compatibility for predictive modeling.
- **Rich Features**: The data includes a mix of academic, demographic, and external socioeconomic factors, providing a comprehensive basis for building predictive models.

This analysis confirms that the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for further preprocessing and model development.
